My final project submission for CSCB58 (Computer Organization) at UTSC for the semester of Summer 2023.

This is a simple platformer written in MIPS assembly containing the following features:
1. Pick-up effects
2. Double Jump
3. Moving objects/pickups	
4. Win Condition  (reach top of screen)		
5. Fail Condition (fall to the bottom)	
6. Moving Platforms

The game can be run on the MARS MIPS simulator.

Permission was given to students to release this code on GitHub.
